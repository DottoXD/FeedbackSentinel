This is an unfinished project i made in a few years ago to learn NextJS.
This serves as a simple alternative to Google Forms to answer simple answers.
I'm not even sure if this actually works, although you can use this as a placeholder for your own project.

# Code quality
The code is most likely not good and hasn't been updated in a long time - i'm not even sure if it works.
If you want to add/fix something or just improve the code please open a pull request.
